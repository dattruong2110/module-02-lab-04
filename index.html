          <h3>Terrain Park Lessons</h3>
          <p>
            This manual is a guide to teaching beginning terrain park maneuvers
            to relatively skilled skiers. There is a demand amongst skiers to
            learn how to use the terrain park and enjoy the thrill of
            performing. The ski instructor has an opportunity to introduce the
            students to basic terrain park skills that will help insure a
            successful outcome in the terrain park. The ski instructor teaching
            beginning terrain park lessons needs not be a former Olympian
            capable of performing a “cork 5 tail” or “alley-oop.” Like a
            football coach who fields a winning team without actually playing,
            the ski instructor can demonstrate relatively easy basic principles
            that will assure success in the terrain park.
